The present study was performed to evaluate the effect of a researched turmeric formulation on oral mucositis in patients receiving chemoradiotherapy for oral cancer. This randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial included 60 patients with oral cancer who had undergone radical surgery. Patients were equally randomized into 3 arms. Bio-enhanced turmeric formulation (BTF) capsules (low dose [1 g/day] or high dose [1.5 g/day]) or placebo was administered daily for 6 weeks with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Study endpoints included the impact of the treatment on chemoradiotherapy-induced oral mucositis along with dysphagia, oral pain, dermatitis, and weight loss. The incidence of grade 3 toxicity of oral mucositis, oral pain, dysphagia, and dermatitis was significantly lower in patients who received BTF than placebo. Twenty-five and 20% patients in BTF 1 g/day (p = 0.011) and 1.5 g/day (p = 0.004) arms, respectively, developed grade 3 oral mucositis compared to 65% patients in the placebo arm. Thirty-five and 30% patients in BTF 1 g/day (p = 0.027) and 1.5 g/day (p = 0.011) arms, respectively, developed grade 3 oral pain compared to 70% patients in the placebo arm. Twenty-five and 20% patients in BTF 1 g/day (p = 0.025) and 1.5 g/day (p = 0.010) arms, respectively, developed grade 3 dysphagia compared to 60% patients in the placebo arm. Ten and 5% patients in BTF 1 g/day (p = 0.114) and 1.5 g/day (p = 0.037) arms. respectively, developed grade 3 dermatitis compared to 30% patients in the placebo arm. Patients under BTF supplementation experienced significantly less weight loss and greater compliance with treatment than placebo. BTF (BCM-95Â®) can significantly reduce chemoradiotherapy-induced severe oral mucositis, dysphagia, oral pain, and dermatitis in oral cancer patients.
